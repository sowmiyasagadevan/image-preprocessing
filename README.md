This repository contains programs developed during my Image Processing Internship, focusing on object counting using OpenCV. The project explores various image pre-processing techniques, edge detection methods, and contour detection algorithms to accurately count objects in an image. Object counting is a crucial task in fields such as industrial automation, medical imaging, and quality control, where precise identification and analysis of multiple objects are required.The approach begins with converting images to grayscale, reducing computational complexity while preserving essential features. Next, edge detection techniques like Canny edge detection are applied to highlight object boundaries. Thresholding methods are then used to separate objects from the background, allowing for clear segmentation. Finally, contour detection and bounding box techniques are employed to identify and count the objects accurately. The results are visualized by drawing contours around detected objects, providing a clear representation of the analysis.
