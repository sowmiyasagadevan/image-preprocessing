This repository contains programs developed during my Image Processing Internship, focusing on object counting using OpenCV. The project explores various image pre-processing techniques, edge detection methods, and contour detection algorithms to accurately count objects in an image. Object counting is a crucial task in fields such as industrial automation, medical imaging, and quality control, where precise identification and analysis of multiple objects are required.

The approach begins with converting images to grayscale, reducing computational complexity while preserving essential features. Next, edge detection techniques like Canny edge detection are applied to highlight object boundaries. Thresholding methods are then used to separate objects from the background, allowing for clear segmentation. Finally, contour detection and bounding box techniques are employed to identify and count the objects accurately. The results are visualized by drawing contours around detected objects, providing a clear representation of the analysis.

This project is implemented using Python, OpenCV, NumPy, and Matplotlib, ensuring efficiency and scalability. Users can clone the repository, install dependencies, and run the object counting script on various images. Future enhancements include extending the functionality to real-time video processing, integrating deep learning-based object detection models, and refining the accuracy with adaptive thresholding and morphological operations.

By leveraging OpenCV's powerful image processing capabilities, this project demonstrates an effective and practical approach to automated object counting, making it valuable for a wide range of real-world applications. ðŸš€
